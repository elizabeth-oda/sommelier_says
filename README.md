# Overview
This project aims to use a variety of ML and DL tools to predict the price and/or points awarded to a wine.
Specifically, I use:
* Basic feature engineering and linear regression
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction
* Word2Vec and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

# Dataset
The dataset can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mysarahmadbhat/wine-tasting). It contains about 130,000 wine reviews published to WineEnthusiast with features such as the country, variety, price, points, etc.
